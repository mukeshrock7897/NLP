    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep an eye 👀 on your deployed NLP models to ensure they stay **accurate, reliable, and cost-efficient** in the real world 🌍.\n",

    "## ⚙️ What to Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "* 📈 **Model Performance** → Track accuracy, F1, BLEU/ROUGE, perplexity drift\n",
    "* 📊 **Data Drift** → Detect shifts in input distribution vs. training data\n",
    "* 🧠 **Concept Drift** → Monitor changes in real-world meaning/context of text\n",
    "* ⏱️ **Latency & Throughput** → Ensure low response time, handle scale smoothly\n",
    "* 💰 **Cost & Resource Usage** → GPU/CPU/memory utilization, API call costs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Monitoring Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🔍 **Model Metrics Dashboards** → Prometheus + Grafana, MLflow Tracking\n",
    "* 🤖 **AIOps / MLOps Platforms** → Weights & Biases, EvidentlyAI, WhyLabs\n",
    "* ☁️ **Cloud Monitoring** → AWS CloudWatch, GCP Cloud Monitoring, Azure Monitor\n",
    "* 🧩 **Custom Logging** → FastAPI/Flask middleware logs, structured logging\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📡 Feedback Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "* 📝 **User Feedback Collection** → thumbs-up/down, surveys, ratings\n",
    "* 🔄 **Human-in-the-loop** → periodic manual review for quality\n",
    "* 🔁 **Retraining Triggers** → automated pipelines when drift exceeds threshold\n",
